This is a test file for the HIPAA RAG upload functionality.

The upload should now work through the server-side proxy route handler at /api/upload.

This test verifies that:
1. File uploads are handled securely server-side
2. API keys are not exposed to the client
3. The proxy correctly forwards requests to the Render API
4. HIPAA compliance is maintained throughout the process
